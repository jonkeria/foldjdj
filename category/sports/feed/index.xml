<p>Two consecutive IPL finals. Had Ravindra Jadeja not done something superhuman in the last two balls, Gujarat would have won two consecutive IPL titles, becoming the first team after Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings . Captain Hardik Pandya would have also entered a small list.</p>



<p>After Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir, Pandya also won at least two titles as a captain. In the end it didn&#8217;t happen anymore. He lost to Dhoni, whom he admires. Pandya doesn&#8217;t regret losing the final, as the Gujarat captain doesn&#8217;t mind losing to Dhoni.</p>



<p>Gujarat released a video paying tribute to Dhoni before facing Chennai in the first qualifier of the IPL. In that video, Gujarat captain Pandya said about &#8216;Captain Cool&#8217; Dhoni, &#8216;I am a fan of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. You have to be a devil to hate Mahi (Dhoni) .&#8217;</p>



<p>What Pandya said even after the match yesterday, it is clear how much his devotion is towards Dhoni. About Dhoni, the Gujarat captain said, &#8216;I am very happy for Dhoni. It was written in his fate. If I have to lose, I don&#8217;t mind losing to Dhoni. Good things happen to good people.&#8217;</p>



<p>Gujarat skipper Pandya is not making excuses for the loss, saying Chennai played better cricket than Gujarat, saying, &#8216;We win together, we lose together. I am not one to make excuses. Chennai played better cricket than us. The name of Sai Sudarshan must be mentioned. He will do something incredible in the future. I am very happy with the cricketers.&#8217;</p>



<p>Jadeja, who won the final with 10 runs off the last 2 balls, dedicated Chennai&#8217;s title to Dhoni, &#8216;As a team, we want to dedicate this title to Dhoni, a special member of our team.&#8217;</p>
