It will be launched for spying next June. State-owned media reported this Tuesday, quoting a senior defense official of the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan said on Monday that it has learned that Pyongyang may launch an artificial satellite this week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country&#8217;s state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted Ri Pyong-chol, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of North Korea&#8217;s ruling party, as saying that the &#8216;Military Reconnaissance Satellite Number One&#8217; will be launched in June.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier on April 13, North Korea tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile. According to the country&#8217;s government, it is a &#8216;solid fuel&#8217; missile. The name is &#8216;Hwasong-18&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The missile is said to be the &#8216;most powerful&#8217; in North Korea&#8217;s arsenal. According to the state-owned media KCNA, Hwasong-18 can be launched relatively quickly as a solid fuel missile. These missiles are difficult to detect and counter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said at the time that the successful test of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-18 would increase the fear and anxiety of rival countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last March, a major joint military exercise &#8216;Freedom Shield 23&#8217; was held between South Korea and the United States. It is the largest US-South Korea joint military exercise in five years. North Korea opposes this exercise. Before and after the exercise, the country showed its strength by firing one missile after another.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>North Korea will launch a military satellite to monitor the military activities of the US and its allies.
