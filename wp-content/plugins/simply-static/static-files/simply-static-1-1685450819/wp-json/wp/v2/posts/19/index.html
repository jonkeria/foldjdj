The family could not afford to buy him sanitary napkins during his schooling. Tamara was teased by schoolmates during her period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara grew up in a poor suburb of South Africa&#8217;s Eastern Cape Province. Age now 27 years. His mother is a &#8216;single mother.&#8217; As a child, she saw her mother using old clothes during menstruation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara took at least a week off from school during menstruation. He had to learn to use clothes like his mother, even if it was uncomfortable. Tamara is now using that difficult childhood experience. She said, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t want the situation I went through during my period to be with anyone else.&#8217; Tamara plans to build an organization to alleviate the suffering of the poor during menstruation. And now he distributed sanitary pads to hundreds of schools in the Eastern Cape from that institution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From the shack to the world<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara Magwashu is starting to get recognition for this work. This year, he has been nominated in the list of 30 entrepreneurs and social changemakers under the age of 30 (Thirty Under Thirty) of the American magazine &#8216;Forbes&#8217;. This list is made with young entrepreneurs from different countries of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara tells the story of her life in Duncan Village, East London. He said, he spent his whole life in a shack. There were no windows in this room. There was no water line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After leaving school he decided to work part-time. The idea was to support the family from the earnings of this job. Also thought that during menstruation she could spend money on sanitary pads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara also said, &#8216;Aside from studying, I started working. So that I can buy sanitary pads from my earnings. It is very uncomfortable to use cloth during menstruation.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamara also said that there was very little knowledge about menstruation at that time. Because of this, it was very difficult to understand why she was having menstrual pain as a teenager. Tamara was not the only one who went through such a situation. Countless girls and women have gone through this situation and are still going through it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tamara Magwashu&#8217;s family was in financial trouble.
