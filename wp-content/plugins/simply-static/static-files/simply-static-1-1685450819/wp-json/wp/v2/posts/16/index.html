The festival will be held after the announcement of the results. But it didn&#8217;t happen anymore. The festival was cancelled. Because most of the students failed. This happened in Texas, America.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the New York Post, there are 33 students in a diploma course at Marlin High School in Texas. 28 failed in the end of course examination, only 5 passed. As most of the students failed, the graduation ceremony was stopped in that high school in the United States. Not only failed, the attendance rate of these 28 students is also very low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a CNN report, the date of the re-organization of the graduation ceremony has been announced at the high school in Texas. Merlin High School said in a Facebook post that the date of the graduation ceremony will be announced in June. However, before this, the attendance and academic results of the failed students should be improved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative is part of a larger effort by Marlin Independent School District to meet student success and academic expectations, the school said. They also said that the district has announced to provide all necessary facilities and support to the students. And as part of fulfilling this promise, the graduation program has been given a new date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We remain steadfast in our commitment to student success,&#8221; the school&#8217;s principal, Daryl Henson, said in a statement. We believe that every student at Merlin can and will achieve the goals they desire. We don&#8217;t impose ambition on students, we expect it from them. We expect our students to maintain the same high standards as other students in Texas.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A meeting of parents and teachers was held in the school on May 24. Principal Henson told the meeting, Texas has some graduation rules. This is not a dance floor. It is a school graduation ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief Education Officer Nikisha Edward said in a statement, &#8216;Educational institutions have taken various initiatives for underachieving students. For example, various initiatives including more classes per week. Initiatives have also been taken to make students focus more on their studies during their stay in educational institutions. We are also looking at increasing attendance.&#8217;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everything is ready for the graduation party.
